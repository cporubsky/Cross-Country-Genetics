## About
This web application was created as a quick and easy way for Cross Country Genetics (CCG) employees to complete, view, and manipulate forms throughout the process of freezing, thawing out, and transferring embryos from one cow to another. In the past, this process has all been done on paper, leading to file cabinets full of thousands of papers recording the history of the cows, clients, and embryo transfers over decades, a process which CCG wanted to move on from in favor of a web application.

# How to Use

## Individual Donor File
After creating an account, the first form that would need to be filled out is titled "Individual Donor file". In order to successfully fill this form out, at minimum, both the "ID Number" (donor tag) and "Owner" fields must be filled out. The rest of the form follows the formatting of the individual donor file paper form, with the exception of the freezing and treatment sections having "plus" and "minus" pictures that can be clicked in order to create or delete a row in the section, which allows for a history of donor information to be filled out.

Click the plus and minus buttons to add or remove rows

## View and Edit Previous Forms
After this form has been filled out, you can then return to the main page and use the search feature at the top of the page in order to view previous forms that contain that donor tag and/or client. This will take you to a table of all the relevant information for the search. If you select a row, fill out a form type, and then click the "Edit Form" button, it will take you to the form that you chose, already filled out with the latest information for the donor ID/client. From here, you're able to then edit the form to your needs and click the "Update" button, which will save all of your updates.

## Collection Form (ABC Form)
After filling out the individual donor file, the next step in the process would be to fill out the collection form. After filling out the "Tag or Tattoo" and "Owner" fields with information used from the "Individual Donor File", most of the "A" section of the form will be auto-filled for you with the relevant information. Then, like in the "Individual Donor File", you can fill out the rest of the form to your needs and click the "Submit" button, which creates a collection form for that donor.
